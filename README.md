Abstract: The primary goal of captive primate management is to ensure optimal health and welfare of the species in our care. Given that the gut microbiome interacts closely with host metabolism, immunity, and even cognition, it represents a potentially powerful tool for identifying changes in health status. However, thus far, it has not been widely tested or implemented as a monitoring tool. In this study, we used longitudinal microbiome sampling of newly arrived chimpanzees at Chimp Haven to explore the feasibility of using the gut microbiome as a health and welfare biomarker in a sanctuary environment. We also tested the hypothesis that a transition to a new living environment, and integration into new social groupings, would result in temporal changes in chimpanzee gut microbiome composition. We found limited evidence for microbial change over time that was consistent across individuals. In contrast, social group and enclosure, and to a lesser extent, age and sex, were strongly associated with differences in gut microbiome composition. Microbiome composition was also associated with overall health status. However, many of the effects we detected were most apparent when using longitudinal data, as opposed to single time point samples. Additionally, we found important effects of technical factors, specifically outdoor temperature and time to collection, on our data. Overall, we demonstrate that the gut microbiome can be effectively deployed as a tool for health and environmental monitoring in a population of captive chimpanzees, but the design must be carefully considered. We encourage other institutions to apply these approaches and build on the utility of gut microbiome analysis for ensuring the welfare of captive primates in a range of contexts.
